  DM PACK

  Declare the DMPackCreateDataModelXML function which will be 
    implemented once per ccsp component.
  At runtime a function pointer to DMPackCreateDataModelXML is 
    passed into ccsp-common where it will be called to 
    create the xml dom tree.  This will replace how
    ccsp-common loads the xml from disk and parses that
    xml into the dom tree.
