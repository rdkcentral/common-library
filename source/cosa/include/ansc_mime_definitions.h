/*
 * MIME has been carefully designed as an extensible mechanism, and it is expected that the set of
 * content-type/subtype pairs and their associated parameters will grow significantly with time.
 * Several other MIME fields, notably including character set names, are likely to have new values
 * defined over time. In order to ensure that the set of such values is developed in an orderly,
 * well-specified, and public manner, MIME defines a registration process which uses the Internet
 * Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for such values.
