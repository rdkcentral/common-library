/*
 * BREE is the counter-part of the old 'WCP' component in BMW 1.0 architecture, though WCP did much
 * more than BREE does in the new architecture. Because of the separation between BREE, BEEP (BSP
 * Execution Environment Plan) and WRM (Web Resource Management), less functionality is required in
 * BREE. One of the biggest difference between BREE and 'WCP' is the generation of the response is
 * now completely objectized.
