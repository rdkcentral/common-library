/*
 * The BWRM framework provides a generic read/write interface for accessing static web pages. This
 * is done by using the undering file system I/O wrappers. In addition to file access, the BWRM_RAM
 * interface provides a cache control for those modules that require significant time to process/
 * parse static web pages.
